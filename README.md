# Ephemera

This guide offers everything you need to assemble a versatile e-paper picture frame that refreshes its display daily. At its heart is a Waveshare seven-color e-paper display, enhanced with the Floyd-Steinberg Dithering algorithm to give the impression of greater color depth. With the included BMP-Converter, you can easily prepare and customize your own images for display. The frame also supports internet connectivity, allowing you to schedule specific images for special days. Powered by a 1000mAh battery, the setup can run for up to 700 days on a single charge, with convenient recharging available via the ESP32's type-C port.


**Ephemera** is a dynamic e-paper project that brings fresh visual inspiration every day. It curates and displays a new, unique image daily, celebrating the fleeting beauty of each moment. Designed to capture the essence of *ephemera*—the transitory and temporary—this project offers a constantly evolving collection of images, here today and replaced tomorrow.

Whether you're here for daily inspiration, a unique view, or just curious to see what’s new, Ephemera invites you to enjoy each passing frame.
